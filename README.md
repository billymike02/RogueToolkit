# Rogue Toolkit
An addon designed to assist artists in the creation of multifaceted sci-fi scenes within Blender.

### Key Features:
- Easy generation and customization of starfields
- Streamlined rigging of objects to paths
- Automated and polished system for creating 'laser beams'

### Target Audience:
This addon is intended for Blender artists who have felt constrained by the clunky and messy setup of scenes that stifle creativity.

The intent is to provide a 'front-end' solution to many of the challenges of creating sci-fi scenes within Blender.

### Why I Created This:
As a big fan of sci-fi, getting into Blender towards the start of 2020 and the coronavirus pandemic was a massive creative outlet. Having spent a lot of time making animations of a certain style (YouTube channel linked below), I got very tired of having to apply brute force to Blender in order to achieve my desired renders.
